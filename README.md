# MariaDB Backup Tool by WhiteKuma

An easy-to-use MariaDB incremental backup tool.

## Motivation

- I was using `mysqldump` to backup my database, but it does not support incremental backup. It is not so efficient
- Cannot find an easy-to-use incremental backup tool
- `mariabackup` command line is a good tool, but it is too hard to use without GUI
- Full TypeScript project
